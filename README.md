Are you interested in the _Curry-Howard Correspondence_? Maybe we're on the same wave-length.

---

Here are some key ideas that make sense to me:
- Pragmatism over correspondence theory
- Focusing on solutions rather than getting stuck on how things 'ought to be'
- You'll make mistakes anyway, might as well get it over with (confront your fear of mistakes)
- Aesthetics are important
- Pursuing many deep interests leads to a rich outlook on life
- Talk to people
- Acknowledge what you want
